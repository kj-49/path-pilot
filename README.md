## Path Pilot

__Path Pilot__ is a self-navigating robot built on an [AVR128DB28](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/avr128db28) microcontroller. It was developed as part of a project during my second year of Electrical Engineering.

## PCB
As an additional aspect of our project, our group had the opportunity to design and order a PCB for our circuit. This was our first exposure to PCB design, and since it wasn't a requirement for the project, we had to learn how to use PCB design software independently. [Here](https://github.com/kj-49/path-pilot/tree/main/pcb/path-pilot-pcb) is what we came up with.
