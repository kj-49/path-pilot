## Path Pilot

Path Pilot is a self-navigating robot built running on an [AVR128DB28](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/avr128db28) microcontroller and built for a project during my 2nd of Electrical Engineering.

## PCB
As a bonus to our project, our group was given the opportunity to order a PCB for our circuit design. Given this was our first exposure to PCB designing and not a requirement to the project, it was neccessary for us to learn PCB design software on our own. [This](https://github.com/kj-49/path-pilot/tree/docs/pcb/path-pilot-pcb) is what we came up with.
